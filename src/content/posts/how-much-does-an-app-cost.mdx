If you've ever wondered why apps have different prices, you're not alone. The cost of an app can vary widely, and several factors influence these prices. As a buyer, understanding these factors can guide you to the most suitable pricing range. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of what goes into app pricing.

-   **Platform**: Should your app be available on both iOS and Android?
-   **Design Requirements**: Should your app contain advanced layouts, unique design identity and custom animations?
-   **Backend Infrastructure**: How many technical features, third party integrations and frameworks do you want implemented.


## Platform

The two major players on the mobile market are Apple (iOS) and Android. Although both brands share similar functionalities, their apps run on two different systems. This makes it important to consider if your coming app should target iOS users, Android users or both. 

This is where cross-platform development comes in handy, as it recudes project time and herby costs to develop an app for two platforms in the same codebase. Although cross-platform development is cheaper, it lacks some performance when comparing it to native app development.

## Design Requirements

Over the coming months from now, there are several tools and features in the line:

-   Demo launch of Feedback Hub
-   Demo launch of User Surveys
-   Custom event tracking (web analytics)

## Backend Infrastructure

The founding partners behind Toolbird are 18 year old Simon Maribo, and 17 year old Lasse Osmann, both with experience in software development and digital products.
